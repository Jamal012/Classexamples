 <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   <hr>
   <p>Welcome to my web page! This is the frist example from class. I hope you like it. 
     <p>Here's another paragraph. 
       I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the pervious sentence. The webpage doesn't preserve the same spacing. It formats according to the tag it sees.
  so the line
       breaks
       are
       different
       from the
       source
       also. <b>Go Hawks</b> <p>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph.
   <br><br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
  <p>Here is information about <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/seahawks-49ers-coin-toss-controversy-pete-carroll-geno-smith-add-to-the-confusion-about-what-was-called/>Seahawks</a>"
